WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net microblaze_i/Video_Controller_4regs_0/inst/Video_Controller_4regs_v1_S00_AXI_inst/frogger_background/nxt_pixel_reg[11]_i_2_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin microblaze_i/Video_Controller_4regs_0/inst/Video_Controller_4regs_v1_S00_AXI_inst/frogger_background/nxt_pixel_reg[11]_i_2/O, cell microblaze_i/Video_Controller_4regs_0/inst/Video_Controller_4regs_v1_S00_AXI_inst/frogger_background/nxt_pixel_reg[11]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
